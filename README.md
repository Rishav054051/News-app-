ðŸ“° News App with Tkinter and News API

I recently developed a News App using Python's Tkinter library and the News API. This app allows users to fetch news articles based on their preferred category. Here are some key features:

**âœ… Text-to-Speech:** Users can listen to news articles using the built-in text-to-speech feature.
<br>
**âœ… Dynamic Loading:** Articles are loaded incrementally, providing a seamless browsing experience.
<br>
**âœ… Responsive UI:** The app's user interface adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
<br>
**âœ… Scrollbar Functionality:** Both vertical and horizontal scrollbars are implemented for smooth navigation through articles.
<br>
I'm excited to share this project and welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement! Feel free to check out the code and try the app yourself
